##Crisis 2022: CBDC Programmable Money
**Programmable Money and AI Infrastructure are coming like 1984 gone digital.**

**Best Case Solution:** The CBDC Governance XDAO at [cbdcgovxdao.com](https://cbdcgovxdao.com) seeks membership to make USDC EUROC CBDCX CBDCY CBDCZ etc. campaign contributions to elected sponsors of regulations requiring their national bill of rights, freedoms, and duties to have a **CBDC Bill of Rights** encoded into the administration of their **programmable money** in every nation seeking public trust and confidence towards converting to a sovereign CBDC. 

Thus all three of Ripple's innovative objectives of financial inclusion, retail, and interoperability are enhanced, however, *macroscopic financial inclusion* is of the essence. Consider the situation wherein the human geopolitical monetary, fiscal, debt, everything...crisis increasingly the "smartest people in the world" have quit talking to the wall and started developing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. There is a reason for that: every engineer knows every complex system requires a restoring force or the broken system will self-destruct to the point there is no inclusion financial or otherwise.

Hence the smartest people in the world know it is the long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object of institutionalized geopolitical market manipulation which has generated the total field crisis requiring global reset. Financial inclusion is therefore about resetting public trust and confidence in respecting every nation's bill of rights when administering CBDCs thus generating a *macroeconomic restoring force*. Wherein, once again, the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-javascript.html) will be shown to form the underlying interoperability backbone to said human-ai geopolitical complex system restoring force. 

##Charter Ratification Vote for CBDC Governance XDAO
First order of business is the **CBDC Governance XDAO charter ratification vote** seeking to establish membership to make USDC EUROC CBDCX CBDCY CBDCZ etc. **quarterly campaign contributions** to elected sponsors of regulations requiring their national bill of rights, freedoms, and duties to have a **CBDC Bill of Rights** encoded into the administration of their **programmable money** in every nation converting to a sovereign CBDC. Membership and Voting is open on the [XDC Network](https://explorer.xinfin.network) at [cbdcgovxdao.com](https://cbdcgovxdao.com) wherein the ratification vote ends on the US midterm election day 8 November 2022. Two other proposals indicating technical perspective are ```IN PROGRESS```:
- **Proposal to Fund Sponsors of a Token Safe Harbor 2.0 Bill:** Incentive is for capable legislators, such as Rep. Patrick McHenry, to encode SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's [Token Safe Harbor 2.0 proposal](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) into law. Next phase is a Solidity smart contract on the [Codius] (https://codius.org/) hosting platform, monitored by its smart contract event Oracles, will detect when such a bill is sponsored on the Congressional Register and start making its USDC quarterly campaign donations.
- **Proposal to Fund Sponsors of Adjustable 15% Flat Tax** An Adjustable Flat tax is proposed initially set to 15%, adjustable every two-year Congressional Election cycle, according to how much voters are willing to pay for candidates' campaign promises vs forming an 87K IRS army which the GOP might suddenly think is a great idea if gaining control of Congress. 
- **Proposals are recorded on the [XRP Ledger](https://livenet.xrpl.org) using the [XRP Stamp Data notarization file system](https://xrpstamp.com).**
- **LaTeX template for Member Proposals** is available in [CBDC Governance XDAO GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ehounder/CBDC-Governance-XDAO-Funds-Sponsors-of-CBDC-Bill-of-Rights) whereas LaTeX editors are available for free download for all operating systems. Members are encouraged to write proposals on known matters including accredited investors, naked shorts, asset confiscation, and so on.

##Invitation for Membership in CBDC Governance XDAO
Global invitation is extended for membership in the [CBDC Governance XDAO](https://cbdcgovxdao.com) to everyone interested in more efficient self-interest representation in the current global crisis of the monetary, fiscal, taxation, total economic imperialism reset of the emergent digital Industrial Revolution 4.0:
- 1st Vote for CBDC Governance XDAO charter ratification ends on US Midterm Election day 8 November 2022.
- Quorum for all voting proposals is set at 60%
- Membership requires Chrome extension [Metamask wallet address](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) to connect with XDAO app. 
- Voting for new members repeats every day per standard XDAO rules & tutorials on [XDAO app website](https://www.xdao.app). 
- Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens are minted by XDAO apps as XinFin Network investment instruments, wherein the present LP CBDCG Token initial public offer of **1 LP CBDCG Token = 1 USDC** is for half of AUM to go towards funding sponsors of CBDC Bill of Rights measures and half invested in XinFin investments seeking 7% or better. 

##XDC Network XDPoS vs Ethereum 2.0 PoS Forkery
The XDC Network is an independent blockchain optimized for international trade and finance powered by its native coin XDC. [On 20 September 2021 the world's first trade financed based NFT transaction was successfully completed by the Tradeteq XinFin XDC Network.](https://treasury-management.com/news/xinfins-xdc-network-and-tradeteq-launch-worlds-first-trade-finance-based-nft-transaction/). This transaction set the standard for all future NFT-based and tokenized trade finance transactions, wherein the XDC Network Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) protocol highly-scalable secure, 2000TPS, 2-second Solidity smart contract transaction time, is already compliant with the ISO 20022 regulatory guidelines and enterprise commercial trade finance standards.

Said transaction standard is exactly the PoS scalability, reliability, and low fee solution the Ethereum 2.0 forkery has been struggling to achieve since the unregistered Ethereum Alliance ICO. However, the latest countdown to a 15 September 2022 fork is encountering conflicting technical and financial counter-incentives - meaning stablecoins like Circle have no incentive to validate USDC on two separate forks and EVM node operators are leveraged into maintaining high (banking) transaction gas fees.

##XDCPay Wallet Chrome Extension
An **[XDCPay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdcpay/bocpokimicclpaiekenaeelehdjllofo)** Chrome extension is available but at this writing has yet to make it on the [Metamask, Wallet Connect, Coinbase Wallet] list of wallets able to connect to XDAO apps.
