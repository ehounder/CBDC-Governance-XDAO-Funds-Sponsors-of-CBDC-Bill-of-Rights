## Human-AI Crisis 2022: CBDC Programmable Money
**Programmable Money and AI Infrastructure are coming like 1984 gone digital.**

**Best Case Solution:** The [CBDC Governance XDAO at worldblockchaincomputer.org](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org) **liquidity providers** fund **USDC EUROC CBDCXYZ campaign contributions** to elected sponsors of legislative measures requiring their  bill of rights, freedoms, duties and so on rendered into the constitutional-financial inclusion of a **CBDC Bill of Rights** in the administration of **[CBDC programmable money (see Sec. 4)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets)** - in exchange for liquidity providers' **capital investments** in global monetary and fiscal-taxation cryptocurrency reset. 

Thus all three of Ripple's innovative objectives of financial inclusion, retail-facing, and interoperability are at work, since 1/2 of the XDAO LP **liquidity provider** tokens are to be invested in the XinFin XDC Network seeking 7% compounded interest 1/2 funding sponsors of CBDC Bill of rights measures which members can withdraw at any time. However, **macroscopic financial inclusion** is of the essence. Consider the reality amid the human geopolitical monetary, fiscal, debt, everything...crisis increasingly the "smartest people in the world" have decided to start developing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. There is a reason for that: every engineer knows every complex system requires a restoring force or the broken system will self-destruct to the point there is no inclusion financial or otherwise.

Hence the smartest people in the world know it is the long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object of institutionalized geopolitical market manipulation which has generated the total field crisis requiring global reset. Financial inclusion is therefore about resetting public trust and confidence in respecting every nation's bill of rights when administering CBDCs thus generating a **macroeconomic restoring force**. Wherein, once again, the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-javascript.html) is operating as the backbone for said human-ai geopolitical complex system restoring force. 

## Charter Ratification Vote for CBDC Governance XDAO
First order of business is the **CBDC Governance XDAO charter ratification vote** by **liquidity providers** towards programable funding of **USDC EUROC CBDCXYZ campaign contributions** to elected sponsors of legislative regulations requiring their national bill of rights, freedoms, and duties to have a CBDC Bill of Rights **constitutional-financial inclusion** into the administration of their **programmable money** in exchange for liquidity providers' XDC Network ```contract``` **capital investments** in global monetary and fiscal-taxation cryptocurrency reset. **Membership-Investment** KYC is via [XDC Network](https://explorer.xinfin.network) **[token-gating](https://twitter.com/MonicaLongSF/status/1562107459942039552)** at [CBDC Governance XDAO](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org) wherein charter ratification vote ends on the US midterm election day 8 November 2022. Two future proposals indicate perspective:
- **Proposal to Fund Sponsors of a Token Safe Harbor 2.0 Bill:** Incentive is for cognizant legislators, such as Rep. Patrick McHenry, to encode SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's [Token Safe Harbor 2.0 proposal](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) into law. Next phase is configuring XDAO [Transaction Automation Module](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org/) when it rolls out perhaps in conjunction with [R3 Corda] (https://developer.r3.com/) Oracle smart contract event monitoring to detecting when such a bill is sponsored on the Congressional Register triggering the proposed USDC campaign donations.
- **Proposal to Fund Sponsors of Adjustable 15% Flat Tax:** Initial rate of 15% adjusted by public vote ballot options every two-year Congressional Election cycle, per voter advocacy and reactions to campaign promises vs forming an 87K IRS army which the GOP might suddenly think is a great idea if gaining control of Congress. 
- **Proposals recorded & transmitted on [XRP Ledger](https://livenet.xrpl.org) via [XRP Stamp Data notarization file system](https://xrpstamp.com) same as land deeds.**
- **LaTeX template for Member Proposals is available in [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ehounder/CBDC-Governance-XDAO-Funds-Sponsors-of-CBDC-Bill-of-Rights) whereas LaTeX editors are available for free download for all operating systems. Members are encouraged to write proposals on known matters including accredited investors, naked shorts, asset confiscation, and so on.**

## Liquidity Provider Financial Inclusion via CBDC Gov XDAO
Global invitation for membership in [CBDC Governance XDAO](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org) extended to **liquidity providers** interested in requiring **constitutional inclusion** in exchange for their capital investments amid the current global crisis of the monetary, fiscal, taxation, total economic imperialism dynamics reset of the emergent digital Industrial Revolution 4.0:
- **1st Vote for CBDC Governance XDAO charter ratification ends on US Midterm Election day 8 November 2022.**
- **Quorum for all voting proposals is set at 60%**
- **Membership requires Chrome extension [Metamask wallet address](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) to sign.**
- **New members tutorials on [XDAO app website](https://www.xdao.app).**
- **Liquidity Provider (LP) Token CBDCLP initial public offer of 1 LP CBDCLP Token = 1 XDC proposal is for 1/2 of AUM to go towards funding sponsors of CBDC Bill of Rights measures and 1/2 towards XinFin Network investment instruments seeking 7% or better which members can withdraw at any time.**
- **[XDCPay](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdcpay/bocpokimicclpaiekenaeelehdjllofo) Chrome extension connecting soon.**

## XRPL Bridging of Global XDC Network XDPoS CBDCs
The XDC Network is an independent blockchain optimized for international trade and finance powered by its native coin XDC. [On 20 September 2021 the world's first trade financed based NFT transaction was successfully completed by the Tradeteq XinFin XDC Network.](https://treasury-management.com/news/xinfins-xdc-network-and-tradeteq-launch-worlds-first-trade-finance-based-nft-transaction/). This transaction set the standard for all future NFT-based and tokenized trade finance transactions, wherein the XDC Network Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) protocol highly-scalable secure, 2000TPS, 2-second transaction time, is already compliant with the ISO 20022 regulatory guidelines and enterprise commercial trade finance standards.

Said transaction standard is exactly the PoS scalability, reliability, and low fee solution the Ethereum 2.0 forkery has been struggling to achieve since the unregistered Ethereum Alliance ICO. However, the latest countdown to a 15 September 2022 fork is encountering conflicting technical and financial counter-incentives - meaning stablecoins like Circle have no incentive to validate USDC on two separate forks and EVM node operators are leveraged into maintaining high (banking) transaction gas fees.

**Hence to optimize with XRP Ledger advisable for Circle to expedite [USDC multi-chain integration](https://www.circle.com/en/multichain-usdc) with XDC Network.**
