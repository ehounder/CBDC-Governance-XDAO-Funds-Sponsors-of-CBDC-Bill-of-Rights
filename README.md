##Information Crisis 2022: CBDC Programmable Money
**Programmable Money and AI Infrastructure are coming like 1984 gone digital.**

**Best Case Solution:** The CBDC Governance XDAO at [worldblockchaincomputer.org](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org) seeks membership to make **USDC EUROC CBDCX CBDCY CBDCZ etc.** campaign contributions to elected sponsors of regulations requiring their national bill of rights, freedoms, and duties to have a **CBDC Bill of Rights** encoded into the administration of their **[programmable money (see Sec. 4)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/14/2022-05471/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets)** in every nation seeking public trust and confidence towards converting to a sovereign CBDC. 

Thus all three of Ripple's innovative objectives of financial inclusion, retail-facing, and interoperability are at work, however, *macroscopic financial inclusion* is of the essence. Consider the reality amid the human geopolitical monetary, fiscal, debt, everything...crisis increasingly the "smartest people in the world" have decided to start developing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. There is a reason for that: every engineer knows every complex system requires a restoring force or the broken system will self-destruct to the point there is no inclusion financial or otherwise.

Hence the smartest people in the world know it is the long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object of institutionalized geopolitical market manipulation which has generated the total field crisis requiring global reset. Financial inclusion is therefore about resetting public trust and confidence in respecting every nation's bill of rights when administering CBDCs thus generating a *macroeconomic restoring force*. Wherein, once again, the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-javascript.html) will be shown to form the underlying interoperability backbone to said human-ai geopolitical complex system restoring force. 

##Charter Ratification Vote for CBDC Governance XDAO
First order of business is the **CBDC Governance XDAO charter ratification vote** seeking to establish membership to make USDC EUROC CBDCX CBDCY CBDCZ etc. **quarterly campaign contributions** to elected sponsors of regulations requiring their national bill of rights, freedoms, and duties to have a **CBDC Bill of Rights** encoded into the administration of their **programmable money** in every nation converting to a sovereign CBDC. Membership and Voting is open on the [XDC Network](https://explorer.xinfin.network) at [CBDC Governance XDAO](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org) wherein the ratification vote ends on the US midterm election day 8 November 2022. Two further technical proposals indicate perspective ```IN PROGRESS```:
- **Proposal to Fund Sponsors of a Token Safe Harbor 2.0 Bill:** Incentive is for cognizant legislators, such as Rep. Patrick McHenry, to encode SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's [Token Safe Harbor 2.0 proposal](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-statement-token-safe-harbor-proposal-2.0) into law. Next phase is to codify proposal on the [r3 Corda smart contract platform](https://developer.r3.com/corda/) including Oracle smart contract event detection when qualifying bills are filed on Congressional Register triggering any proposed USDC campaign donations. 
- **Proposal to Fund Sponsors of Adjustable 15% Flat Tax:** Initial rate of 15% adjusted by public vote ballot options every two-year Congressional Election cycle, per voters social engineering desires, willingness, and reactions to candidates' campaign promises vs forming an 87K IRS army which the GOP might suddenly think is a great idea if gaining control of Congress. 
- **Proposals recorded & transmitted on [XRP Ledger](https://livenet.xrpl.org) via [XRP Stamp Data notarization file system](https://xrpstamp.com) same as land deeds.**

##XDC Network XDPoS vs Ethereum 2.0 PoS Forkery
The XDC Network is an independent blockchain optimized for international trade and finance powered by its native coin XDC. [On 20 September 2021 the world's first trade financed based NFT transaction was successfully completed by the Tradeteq XinFin XDC Network.](https://treasury-management.com/news/xinfins-xdc-network-and-tradeteq-launch-worlds-first-trade-finance-based-nft-transaction/). This transaction set the standard for all future NFT-based and tokenized trade finance transactions, wherein the XDC Network Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) protocol highly-scalable secure, 2000TPS, 2-second transaction time, is already compliant with the ISO 20022 regulatory guidelines and enterprise commercial trade finance standards.

Said transaction standard is exactly the PoS scalability, reliability, and low fee solution the Ethereum 2.0 forkery has been struggling to achieve since the unregistered Ethereum Alliance ICO. However, the latest countdown to a 15 September 2022 fork is encountering conflicting technical and financial counter-incentives - meaning stablecoins like Circle have no incentive to validate USDC on two separate forks and EVM node operators are leveraged into maintaining high (banking) transaction gas fees.
